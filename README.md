# computering-aphorisms
Sadly inspired by [this drivel I posted on LinkedIN.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/polleyg_some-things-i-wish-id-known-before-starting-activity-6781485314570637312-myMp)

Some things I wish I'd known before starting my computering career: 

- Deploy more often
- Don't deploy on Fridays
  - Unless you want to
- Feel confident in your deploy pipeline or fix it until you do
- There's no best language, except for SQL
- Leave recursion to the experts
- ^^ multi-threading & concurrency too
- and out of order messages
- In distributed systems you should expect duplicated
- Good doco is harder than good code
- Git-flow will give you nightmares
- It's always DNS
- Obsessing over Big O is a waste of time
- Over-abstraction is a big mistake
- "password" is not a good password
- Click-ops is perilous
- Most algorithms already exist in libraries
- Inheritance sucks
- In distributed systems you should expect duplicated
- Tech debt isn't always a bad thing
- Don't ignore the politics
- Tech is easy compared to people
- Don't be responsible for things other people own
- Be responsible for the things you own
- Change isn't done until it's in prod
- Project isn't finished until you turn it off
- Your Dev is someone elses Prod
- Your Prod is someone elses Dev
- Define your contracts in writing
